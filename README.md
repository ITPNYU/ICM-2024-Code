## COURSE DESCRIPTION
The 17th century philosopher Spinoza described "wonder" as a state of suspension in the mind, a paralysis resulting from a confrontation with something wholly new, disconnected from past experience such that judgements of whether it is good or bad are not possible. At this moment in time, we are caught in such a state of suspension with digital technologies. Creating computer applications, instead of simply using them will provide you with a deeper appreciation for the essential possibilities, limitations and unknowns of computation.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES
At the completion of this course, the student should be able to:
   - Create interactive, generative drawings with p5.js.
      - Use basic programming control structures such as variables, conditional statements, loops, and functions.
      - Code rules of interaction for standard human-computer interface components (e.g. mouse, keyboard).
      - Assemble and manipulate simple algorithms to create generative drawings.
   - Seek, identify, read, and understand code examples that can be combined and/or modified to implement a personal project idea.

# POLICIES

## COURSE SCHEDULE
The course will meet once a week for two and a half hours for a total of 14 weeks.

## EQUIPMENT
A modern laptop (4 years old or younger is a good rule of thumb).  Limited numbers are available for checkout from the Equipment Room.  

## COURSE MATERIALS
Paper, pencils and erasers. All other tools and materials are available online for free.

## TEACHING STYLE
Classes will be a mixture of lecture-demonstrations, exercises, discussion, homework review, presentations, and small group work. You will need to come to class prepared with a laptop and any other supplies specified for that class.

## BOOKABLE OFFICE HOURS
For one-on-one help with course material and assignments, book office hours with your instructor, any of the residents or the Coding Lab. You can also book office hours with your instructor simply to talk about how you are doing in the class or anything else you think they can help you with.

## DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES AND LEARNING MODES
If you are having trouble with the course as it is structured, reach out to your instructor to begin a conversation about ways to help you engage.

## GRADING
ITP courses are Pass / Fail. Your grade will be determined by the following breakdown:

40% Participation
50% Assignments
10% Final project

## ATTENDANCE POLICY
After the first two weeks of the add/drop period, students are permitted 2 absences.

There are no excused absences and unexcused absences. There are only absences. Any more than 2 absences will affect your participation grade. Two late arrivals (any time after class has begun) will count as 1 absence.

## ASSIGNMENTS
There will be regular assignments that are relevant to the class material. These assignments must be documented (written description, photos, screenshots, screen recording, code, and video all qualify based on the assignment) on the class website. Each assignment is due by class time one week after they are assigned unless stated otherwise.

It is expected that you will spend 6 to 8 hours a week on the class outside of class itself.  This will include reviewing material, reading, watching video, completing assignments and so on. Please budget your time accordingly.

Each assignment will be marked as complete (full credit), partially complete (half credit), or incomplete (no credit). To be complete, an assignment should meet the criteria specified in the syllabus including documentation.  If significant portions are simply not attempted it may be marked partially complete.  If an attempt isn’t made to meet the criteria specified it will be marked incomplete.

## COMMUNICATION
You are responsible for checking your email for important updates about class.

## PARTICIPATION
ITP/IMA is committed to facilitating the fullest possible participation of all students. There are many forms of participation. Please communicate what kinds of engagement are best for you so it can be taken into account.

Examples of modes of participation can look like: asking questions, going to office hours, sending and reading emails, class group discussion, arriving on time, going to class, taking notes, listening to peers, submitting responses to a form (anonymous or not), following instructions, active listening, etc.

## EXTENSIONS
An assignment extension may be granted upon request. If you request an extension before the due date, your grade will not be affected. Please clarify with your instructor and set a deadline together. The recommended timeline is 1 to 5 days.

Note: There may be instances where having an extension may result in not being able to participate fully in activities such as feedback sessions or workshopping ideas/projects, which likely cannot be made up if it could disrupt the overall course schedule. Extensions are distributed at the discretion of the instructor.

## MAKEUP WORK POLICY
Sometimes it is possible to make up for missed work due to an absence. This is only an option for those who have attended more than 50% of the class (if you have missed more than 50% of class sessions, it will result in an automatic F for the course). While there is no distinction in this course between excused and unexcused absences, you may inquire about makeup work. Makeup work could be content you can consume, a conversation with someone in class, additional office hours, writing a paper or an additional project. Not all course content can be made up. Please clarify with your instructor and set a deadline together. The recommended timeline is 1 to 5 days.

## INCOMPLETE GRADES
Incomplete grades may only be given to students who have completed more than 50% of the class assignments. Incomplete grades are given at the discretion of the professor since managing incomplete grades is often additional uncompensated labor for the instructor.

## AI STATEMENT
You should treat AI tools just as you would any other source: cite the source and note how it was used (Harvard has a useful [guide to citation of AIs](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=1330621&p=10046069)). You should be prepared to explain how your use of it is the appropriate tool to fit your goal or concept and does not detract from your experience meeting the learning objectives of the assignment or course. There are some cases where the use of AI may fall under a form of plagiarism. Differentiate your work from your source’s work in a way that's clear to the reader or viewer. Additionally, you should be prepared to discuss the ethical concerns around the widespread use of emerging AI tools.

## STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.


Collaboration is highly valued and often necessary to produce great work. Students build their own work on that of other people and giving credit to the creator of the work you are incorporating into your own work is an act of integrity. Plagiarism, on the other hand, is a form of fraud. Proper acknowledgment and correct citation constitute the difference.

## STATEMENT ON USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES
Laptops and other electronic devices are essential tools for learning and interaction in classrooms. However, they can create distractions that hinder students' ability to actively participate and engage. Please be mindful of the ways in which these devices can affect the learning environment, please refrain from doing non-class oriented activities during class.

## STATEMENT ON TITLE IX
